- Open Graph meta tags (`og:type`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:image`) on all pages
- Canonical `<link>` tags on all pages
- GSAP + `initAnimations()` added to all interior pages (`workshops.html`, `programs/`, `resources.html`, `about.html`, `book.html`, `contact.html`)
- Page-hero entrance animation (eyebrow → h1 → p stagger) on all interior pages
- Footer column reveal animations on all pages
- CTA band content reveal animations on all pages

### Changed
- `.diff-item:hover` — upgraded from border-only to `translateY(-4px)` + shadow + icon scale/rotate
- `.process-step:hover` — upgraded from border-only to `translateY(-4px)` + shadow
- `.audience-icon` — micro-scale on parent hover
- `src/js/components.js` — `initPage()` now injects `#cursor`/`#cursor-follower` on all pages (single source of truth)

- Emoji icons replaced with inline SVGs in `index.html`, `about.html`, `resources.html`

### Fixed
- Broken CSS tokens (`--color-*`, `--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md`) on 6 interior pages — cards were invisible on dark theme
- Custom cursor disappeared on all interior pages
- Native cursor leaked through on `input`, `textarea`, `select` form elements
- Hardcoded cursor divs removed from `index.html` — `initPage()` is now sole injector

### Known Placeholders
- `book.html` / `contact.html` — Formspree endpoint still `REPLACE_ME` (OD-001 open)
- `src/images/` — photography not yet added; og:image URL will 404 until resolved
