## SR-003 — Mobile Responsive Fixes (v2.18.0)
**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Version:** v2.18.0
**Commit:** `ca43fb2`

**Slice:** Four-slice mobile responsive fix pass — nav overlay, photo crop, eyebrow specificity, hamburger breakpoint.

**Pre-review finding:** On-device iPhone screenshots confirmed:
- Open mobile menu leaked page content (heading behind logo, page text below the CTA button)
- Program hero proof photos cropped subjects at forehead level (fixed `180px` + `object-position: center 20%`)
- Corner-radius mismatch between stacked hero images (`--radius-md` vs `--radius-lg`)
- Section-break strip too thin (fixed `180px` + off-center crop)
- Eyebrow label wrapped on mobile due to CSS specificity (`.hero-content p` 16px beat `.eyebrow` 12px)
- iPad portrait (≤1100px): CTA button squished to ~64px by flexbox; label clipped entirely

**Changes:**
- `.mobile-nav`: `inset:0`, solid `--bg`, `padding-top` clears header; `z-index:99`; `opacity`/`transform` open transition
- `body.nav-open .site-header`: opaque while overlay is open
- `closeNav()` helper in `components.js`; closes on link-tap, Escape, `pageshow`
- `@media (max-width: 1100px)`: hide `.site-nav` + `.header-cta`, show `.nav-toggle` + `.mobile-nav`
- `.header-cta { flex-shrink: 0 }` in base styles
- `.hero-content .eyebrow` (specificity 0,2,0) inside `≤1100px` block sets `--text-xs`
- `.page-hero-proof-photo`: `--radius-lg`, `object-position: center center`, `aspect-ratio: 16/10` at ≤768px
- `.program-section-break`: `object-position: center center`, `aspect-ratio: 16/9` at ≤768px
- `.mobile-nav a.btn--primary, :hover { color: #fff }` — specificity fix for CTA colour
- Cache token `?v=mobile-20260619c` on all 10 HTML files

**Post-review result:** Playwright headed preview at 390px and 820px confirmed: no page content bleed-through on open menu; subjects visible in proof photos; eyebrow on one line; hamburger shows at 820px, desktop nav shows on drag past 1100px.

**Risk:** None remaining. Branch `fix/mobile-responsive-20260619` pushed; merge to `main` when owner approves.

## SR-002 — VPS nginx Routing Fix (v2.16.1)
**Date:** 2026-06-17
**Version:** v2.16.1

**Slice:** Fix nginx clean URL routing and custom 404 on staging VPS.

**Pre-review finding:** `curl` confirmed `/workshops.html` → 200 but `/workshops` → 404.
nginx default 404 (162 bytes) served instead of custom `404.html`.

**Change:** Updated `/etc/nginx/sites-available/smart-learning-solutions`:
- `try_files $uri $uri/ =404` → `try_files $uri $uri/ $uri.html =404`
- Added `error_page 404 /404.html; location = /404.html { internal; }`

**Post-review result:** `/workshops`, `/about` → 200. Custom 404 → 2795 bytes. `nginx -t` ok.

**Risk:** None remaining. Config backed up to `smart-learning-solutions.bak` on server.

## SR-001 — v2 Planning Migration (v2.15.0)
**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Version:** v2.15.0
**Commit:** `docs: migrate project planning system to v2`

**What was reviewed:**
- Phase 1 audit of existing docs against v2 required file list
- Gap analysis: 7 missing files identified
- Overlap analysis: AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md duplication; confirmed-decisions scattered across 5 files
- Source-of-truth conflicts mapped

**What was changed:**
- Added 8 missing v2 files (PROJECT_BRIEF, PLAN, PHASE_GATES, BACKLOG, DECISION_LOG, SLICE_REVIEWS, LESSONS_LEARNED, PROGRESS_NOTES)
- Updated CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md with v2 planning system pointers
- Updated STATUS.md and PROGRESS_NOTE.md to v2.15.0

**What was preserved:**
- All existing content in all existing files
- COMMIT_NOTES.md unconditionally
- PROGRESS_NOTE.md unconditionally
- ROADMAP.md, CHANGELOG.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md, STATUS.md, CONTEXT.md
- DECISIONS.md (historical ADRs intact; DECISION_LOG.md is additive)

**Unresolved after this slice:**
- AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md duplication not yet resolved (additive only; merge deferred)
- Confirmed-decisions tables still exist in 5 places (consolidation deferred)
- TASK-polish-and-seo.md at root level not moved (awaiting specific approval)
- README.md version line not updated (kept out of migration scope)
